# Victron_BLE_Advertising_example
This is a minimal example on how to receive, decrypt, and decode Victron SmartSolar BLE advertising beacons.
I'm releasing this on Github to help others overcome the initial hurdles of getting data from the Victron
advertising beacons.

Notes:

I'm new to Github, so don't be surprised if you see wonky things going on here while I play with it.

I'm a hobbyist, not an experienced software developer, so be kind where I've made mistakes or done
things in a weird way.

Yes, I've included my Victron's encryption key in my source code. I understand that's a bad practice, but
in this case I'm willing to accept the risk that you might drive by and be able to decode my SmartSolar data.
The horror!
